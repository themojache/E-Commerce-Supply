# E-Commerce-Supply
Demo ASP.NET Core E-Commerce Supply Site

**To open** Clone/Download the master branch of the repository. Open 
E-Commerce-Supply (either the sln or the csproj file). Run using ISS Express (Ctrl + F5, F5, or the Run button from withing Visual Studio).

Completed at the request of a recruitment agency asking if I could create a quick clone of their clients webite. This was written over a couple days. **Designed it with a setup-less/no-configuration design in mind** (no SQL database connection dependancies). Use of SQL is the [second thing you are recommended to look at when you initally start working with ASP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/working-with-sql).

My main desire was to touch up the site and remove some of the Javascript and library dependancies. I have learned that it is good web design to prevent repetative redirects with menus and to creativly pop up elements in ways which don't require Javascript. Javascript is used in storing Cart information, which would be verified when going to place an order.

## Features
1. Search funtionality (No Database on back end). Load "Boxes, Enclosures" or "Lamps, Balasts" from the categories tab. If you switch to Markets tab then use the "DataComm"/"Lighting" links. Vendors/Manufacturers supported are: "3M" and "Abus". Feel free to use the search bar at the top as well, though it will not load items.
2. General logic of a login system.
3. Simple client sided cart, which could easily be validated as the order coninues on to actually "Placing an order".

## Tech Stack
ASP.NET Core (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript). Mostly adheres to spec. I'm sure there are a few CSS property values or something that I use which have cross browser support but are not in the spec.

## Todo
1. Plenty of UI touch up work (Mostly a focus on Responsive Design as this was all done on a large resolution monitor, though there is some responsive design implemented already). Endless tweaks to make design more appealing.
2. Clean up Javascript (re-write). Also make the localStorage less verbose (Store: ID, Name, Price, and Quantity). Could add a small (reversable) barrier by encoding the data in the cart.
3. Make the items in search a global variable instead, allowing for more re-usability in the functions (Search bar can use contains on the item name for example).
4. Implement some SQL, for User/Items storage. Would be able to add filterabilty on search rather easy with an actual database.
5. Make it so people could actually order items (Payment processing)

## Image/Font Credits
Images are all from the clients site I was tasked with "cloning". Some text was also sampled from their site. Not likely, but if there is an issue with this they can contact me and I will place in some generic images/text in their place.

The Client's site uses IcoMoon font files (some premium varient). I have removed the premium font files from the repositiory in order to not violate any licencing. I have opted to include the IcoMoon-Free varient to display some of the icons of the site.
